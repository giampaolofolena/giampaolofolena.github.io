                            This project investigates the interplay between dynamics and statics in the mean-field p-spin spherical model. The focus was to explore dynamical phase transitions and how asymptotic states can retain memory of their initial conditions, challenging previous assumptions in glassy systems.

                            In this project, we focused on understanding the heterogeneous fluctuations in mean-field glass models. By utilizing the replica method and conducting numerical simulations, we examined non-Gaussian fluctuations, particularly those that arise near the glass transition. Our work has provided valuable insights into the connection between these fluctuations and single-particle correlations.

                            This research explores the geometry of random cages formed by hard spheres. We developed a minimal model to study these cages in infinite-dimensional limits and examined their behavior in finite dimensions. Additionally, the work on jamming transitions across high-dimensional systems contributed to the understanding of the universality class for hard spheres.

                            This project focuses on the study of low-temperature glass phases and the exploration of soft anharmonic spin glasses. We uncover connections between linear excitations and non-linear two-level systems, which contribute to the understanding of low-temperature anomalies in glasses.

                            This research explores the emergence of enzymatic functions within an artificial chemistry framework. By using an algorithmic model, we investigate how enzymes, defined as cyclic functions that combine two functions to produce a new one, can form autocatabolic networks. These networks sustain and amplify themselves, fostering complexity growth and enabling the emergence of self-replication and selection mechanisms.
