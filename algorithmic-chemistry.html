        <h2>Algorithmic Chemistry: Emergence of Enzymes in Artificial Chemistry</h2>
        <p>
            This research explores the emergence of enzymatic functions within an artificial chemistry framework. By using an algorithmic model, we investigate how enzymes, defined as cyclic functions that combine two functions to produce a new one, can form autocatabolic networks. These networks sustain and amplify themselves, fostering complexity growth and enabling the emergence of self-replication and selection mechanisms.
